Challenge - Create VR spaces as NFTs

Create a custom NFT gallery space for 3XR. The platform currently offers default spaces for showcasing NFTs, but aims to allow community members and users to create their own spaces.
Customization could be as simple as applying textures and materials to current spaces, but also adding ambient sounds, decorating with shapes.

For community customization:

1) Generate JSON (contract args) for minting space as an NFT (on Mintbase). Customization can be set on extra metadata fields.
2) Create custom proposal on VR DAO (via Spunik DAO) with args (JSON).
3) R3F (React-Three-Fiber) component that renders minted NFT.
